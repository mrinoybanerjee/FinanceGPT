amount of time should i investits a bad idea to invest money that you will need within several years the stock market is too volatile for any time horizon shorter than 3 to 5 years and investing for less than 10 years is risky its not for the faint of heartfor any time frame under 3 to 5 years you should just use savings or money market accounts  if the idea of low interest rates is too much to bear you can also consider usingi bondsor acd ladderwhile i bond rates are often attractive be aware that i bond purchases are locked up for the first 12 months and if you redeem an i bond within the first 5 years you will lose the last 3 months of interest the higher interest rates compared to savings accounts will often make up for the last 3 months of interest thoughconsider using a mini cd ladder based on cds with shorter terms if the time frame is under 1 to 2 years and bear in mind that cds also often have a lock up period or a significant early withdrawal penaltyif the time frame is 5 years or longer you can consider something like a vanguard lifestrategy fund or a similarly allocatedthreefund portfolio the risk is significant that you will lose money because its a relatively short time frame for an investment that is based on stocks and bonds  you need to be prepared for a scenario where a poorly timed downturn could affect your plans for the money  to put it another way more than half of the time it will be a win based on past history but sometimes it will not be a winif that seems too risky for you stick with savings accounts money market accounts cds or maybe some i bonds as long as the 12month lockup isnt an issue see abovejust bear in mind that there is a different risk to not investing aggressively enough if your investments are not outpacing inflation about 2 a year in recent history you may be losing actual value over time despite your investments being worth more nominally historically stocks tend to outpace inflation the best bonds also generally outpace inflation but the margin tends to be significantly smallerfor borderline time frames of 3 to 5 years aggressive investors may consider one of the more conservative vanguard lifestrategy funds

especially for beginners takes advantage of diversifiedfundsof stocks and bonds instead of purchasing shares of specific companies like coke you buy into mutual funds or exchange traded funds which in turn own hundreds or thousands of companies in this way you get the upside benefit of the general trend of stock markets to go up and eliminate the extreme volatility and risk that can come with holding single stocks  good brokers to purchase shares of index funds from include vanguard fidelity and charles schwabprioritize funds with low expensesin general stock and bond funds can be divided into two categoriesactively managed fundsthese funds have a management team that is actively picking and choosing buying and selling stocks in an attempt to beat the market and buy low sell high unfortunately they often come with much higherfeesindex fundshold stocks or bonds according to an index like the sp 500 and dont change at all except when the index changes rarely due to this the expenses are often much lower expense ratios below 03 no sales loadsresearch continues to show that in general people holding low expense index funds out perform people holding actively managed funds

retirementif you want something simple to start and you have income to invest save 1000 and open a roth or traditional depending on your tax circumstances ira with vanguard or schwab see below for fund suggestionsanother important thing to do is to read about investing for retirement check out thesuggested reading listand follow threads inrpersonalfinanceabout the topic ask questions as they come up if they arent in the wikishould i invest a lump sum all at once or employ a dollar cost averaging strategydollar cost averaging dca is a strategy in which you spread out your investment of a given sum over time  for example if you have 12000 to invest you could invest 3000 every quarter 1000 every month or any other increment you want  dca reduces your shortterm risk by ensuring that your entire sum is not invested at temporarily inflated priceshowever it is important to understand that dca is not the financially optimal strategy  vanguard found that lump sum investing lsi ie investing all of your available funds immediately outperformed a dca strategy based on historical performance pdf 12  since the longterm historical trend of equities has been up this makes sense intuitively as well  lump sum investors are compensated for taking on the equity risk premium high risk high reward sooner rather than laterwhich strategy is best for you is a highly personal decision  as vanguard statesto be comfortable with either strategy an investor must be fully aware of the fact that historical averages are only a guide  it is still possible for lsi or dca to underperform or even lose money in any given period if an investor is uncomfortable with the risks associated with a given market entry strategy it may imply a low willingness to take risk in general and if so we recommend revisiting the target asset allocation to ensure that it appropriately addresses risk tolerance levels and investing goalsfor an academic analysis of lsi vs dca seeconstantides  a note on the suboptimality of dollarcost averaging as an investment policy  finance author larry swedroe offers his thoughts on lsi vs dca inthis articlenote lsi vs dca refers to a sum you have on hand and are

it may seem strange that so many people definitely not everyone recommend vanguard onrpersonalfinance a lot has been written on this but the basic arguments that most fans will give are as followsvanguard created the first index fund available to individual investors and continues to be more focused and dedicated to index fund investing than other companiesvanguard has a unique clientowned structurerather than being publicly traded or privately owned vanguard is owned by its own funds and those funds are owned by vanguard customersvanguard has a broader selection of lowcost index funds and their actively managed funds are generally very low in costthe worst case fees that an unsavvy investorcouldend up paying for funds advice or asset management are generally going to be significantly lower at vanguardmost vanguard mutual funds are more taxefficient and suitable for use in taxable accounts while investors generally need to use etfs to reach the same level of

international stocks  a domestic stock allocation of 60 to 80 is commonly recommended with 20 to 40 allocated to international stocks  the average target date fund allocates about 13 of the equity allocation to international stocks sourcemorningstar  for investors outside of the us it is common to recommend allocating a much smaller percentage to domestic stocks eg 20 to 30 although costs and other countryspecific factors need to be consideredwhenever you add money instead of adding money in the original proportions add the money in such a way that after you add money your portfolio is closer to your desired proportions  if you dont add money at least once a year or if you dont add enough to rebalance as close as you want log in once a year and sell off the winners that are worth more than their proportion and buy the losers that are worth less than their proportion  you dont have to hit these proportions exactly  getting within a few percent is finefor more specific recommendations consider any of thelazy portfolios listed in the bogleheads wikiwhat bond percentage should i havefirst of all if youre using a target date fund the bond allocation is already managed for you as part of theglide pathprocess that gradually adjusts the allocation of a target date fund over time therefore you only need to consider bond allocation for investments that arenottarget date fundsits not a great idea for anyone to be invested 100 into stocks or 100 into bonds  historically stock investments have more volatility than bonds and bonds dont outpace inflation as well as stocks  for virtually all investors a mix of both asset classes is a good idea in your investments after setting up an emergency fund and paying off expensive debts of coursetherefore you need to decide what percentage you want to hold in bonds and what percentage in stocks  this is a complex topic but some simple approaches aresubtract your age from 100 or 110 allocate that percentage to stocks and the remainder is your bond allocationsubtract your age from 130 or 120 allocate that percentage to stocks cap at 100 and the remainder is your bond allocationuse your age in bonds eg a 20yearold would hold 20 bondswhile some investors do decide to leave out bonds most target date funds always include at least 10 bonds even for investors very far from retirement  holding less in bonds will result in higher volatility so a 100 stock allocation will result in the highest possible volatilityif youre still uncertain about your bond allocation look at the allocation used by thevanguard target date

probably not worth the effort until you have at least 30000 or even 50000 invested overall if a target date fund is working for you stick with it as long as you wantif youre doing this in a taxable account rather than an ira you should consider building a threefund portfolio instead because target date funds are generally not taxefficient this is not a factor in an ira 401k plan or other taxadvantaged retirement accounts of courseotherwise you may be best served by athreefund portfoliowhich typically consists of the following individual fundsus total stock market index fundetf options

international stocks  a domestic stock allocation of 60 to 80 is commonly recommended with 20 to 40 allocated to international stocks  the average target date fund allocates about 13 of the equity allocation to international stocks sourcemorningstar  for investors outside of the us it is common to recommend allocating a much smaller percentage to domestic stocks eg 20 to 30 although costs and other countryspecific factors need to be consideredwhenever you add money instead of adding money in the original proportions add the money in such a way that after you add money your portfolio is closer to your desired proportions  if you dont add money at least once a year or if you dont add enough to rebalance as close as you want log in once a year and sell off the winners that are worth more than their proportion and buy the losers that are worth less than their proportion  you dont have to hit these proportions exactly  getting within a few percent is finefor more specific recommendations consider any of thelazy portfolios listed in the bogleheads wikiwhat bond percentage should i havefirst of all if youre using a target date fund the bond allocation is already managed for you as part of theglide pathprocess that gradually adjusts the allocation of a target date fund over time therefore you only need to consider bond allocation for investments that arenottarget date fundsits not a great idea for anyone to be invested 100 into stocks or 100 into bonds  historically stock investments have more volatility than bonds and bonds dont outpace inflation as well as stocks  for virtually all investors a mix of both asset classes is a good idea in your investments after setting up an emergency fund and paying off expensive debts of coursetherefore you need to decide what percentage you want to hold in bonds and what percentage in stocks  this is a complex topic but some simple approaches aresubtract your age from 100 or 110 allocate that percentage to stocks and the remainder is your bond allocationsubtract your age from 130 or 120 allocate that percentage to stocks cap at 100 and the remainder is your bond allocationuse your age in bonds eg a 20yearold would hold 20 bondswhile some investors do decide to leave out bonds most target date funds always include at least 10 bonds even for investors very far from retirement  holding less in bonds will result in higher volatility so a 100 stock allocation will result in the highest possible volatilityif youre still uncertain about your bond allocation look at the allocation used by thevanguard target date fundthat would be appropriate for you based on your expected retirement date andor birth yearrelated subredditsrbogleheadslast revised bydequeued...\n"
